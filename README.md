# GameGenie_in_C
GameGenie Encoder Decoder and Master List Generator Ported to C .

GameGenie Ported to C from Various sources , use of efficent algorithms and removing time complexity thus making it more efficent.

GameGenie Encoder :
It Generates 6 or 8 character GameGenie based on whether input has compare value or not.
it encodes GameGenieCode based on Address and Value based in HEX Values.

GameGenie Decoder :
It decodes 6-character GameGenie to Address and data.

Uses efficent algorithm to achieve maximum efficency in generating Large Chunk of Codes.
Input cannot be duplicates remember that it has to be different 2-16 Chars combination.


GameGenieMasterList.txt :
This is Output of 5-Character GameGenieCodes generated from GameGenieMasterListGenerator 
it contains 15625 GameGenieCodes with their equivalent Address and Data Values.

Feel Free to Distribute/Use it in your own project.
